# RMMBY RM
A rework of the RMMBY Mod Manager and the RMMBY Installer

Moving most of the work RMMBY does and putting it into a separate application instead of having it always running in-game will make it lighter to run. Removing most features from the in-game mod should also assist in reduce and preventing various game specific bugs.

Allowing games to open and interact with the new mod manager directly will also make RMMBY easier to bring to other games, and make the user experience consistant between games. 

More GameBanana integration will be added in the future. With the mod manager's ability to communicate with games, the GameBanana integration should make game modding very seamless.

The original RMMBY Installer's functionality will be added, making the installer easier to understand and make the installer feel more connected to RMMBY. Installation will now use only one window. This will make installation easier to track, and make certain installation failures more known to the user.
